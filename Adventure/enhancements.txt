The final exam puzzle can only be taken if the player has met the following conditions:

The final exam puzzle consists of 5 math questions. Each question is shown to the player,
who must then input an answer for the question. Regardless of whether the player's answer was right or wrong, the final exam will continue
and display the next question to the player.

At the end of the final exam, the player's grade is totaled.

Enhancement: Time
A starting time can be set and an exam time can be set. The game keeps track of the current time in-game.
The player must find all of the items and return to the exam room before current time reaches the game time.
Each time the player moves to a location, searches a location, or buys coffee, time passes.

Enhancement: Tiredness & Coffee:
Tiredness affects the amount of time that passes when moving to a location or searching it.
The more tired a player is, the more time it takes to complete one of the aforementioned actions, adding to the time pressure of the game.
Furthermore, a player’s tiredness increases automatically if he or she chooses to move, so it is even more important to conserve moves.
The player’s tiredness can be decreased by buying coffee, which costs time but reduces the tiredness, saving time in the long term.
